A simple filament sensor added to the extruder mount. The base file used was the Papilio extruder mount, but that mount has so many mounting points, many other extruders should work for it too.

BOM:
- D2F microswitch (or similar), doesn't need to be super accurate - we're not setting z-position here
- 5.5mm ball bearing (https://a.co/d/6RdxncY) or (https://a.co/d/gXpXHlg) for example
- M2x8 self-tapping screws (2x)

Wiring is a little tight. I had to trim the legs of the switch down to get it to fit well.
