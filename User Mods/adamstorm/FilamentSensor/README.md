A simple filament sensor added to the extruder mount. The base file used was the Papilio extruder mount, but that mount has so many mounting points, many other extruders should work for it too.

This extruder mount is 4mm taller than the normal version to make room for the sensor.

BOM:
- D2F microswitch (or similar), doesn't need to be super accurate - we're not setting z-position here
- 5.5mm ball bearing (example: https://a.co/d/6RdxncY or https://a.co/d/gXpXHlg)
- M2x10 self-tapping screws (2x)

Wiring is a little tight. I had to trim the legs of the switch down to get it to fit well.
