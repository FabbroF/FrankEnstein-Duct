#### Updates

02.07.2023: Overlap fix + Dragon
- Fixed the little overlap between the extruder mounts and the hotendmounts on the rear screw point
- Added a mount for the Phaetus Dragon

26.06: I made an oopsie + BMS7 fin
- My mistake, I made a mistake with the basic layout of the first design so the stock hotend and 1:1 replacements won't fit (I used the 6 fin BMS as a reference and not the 7 fin BMS). This means that all the parts except the duct will not fit and will have to be reprinted if you have already printed them (I don't think anyone has done that, but just in case) (okay Andy - I'm sorry)
- Added a mount for the BMS fin
