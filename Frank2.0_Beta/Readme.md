#### Updates

26.06: I made an oopsie + BMS7 fin
- My fault, I made an mistake with the basic layout of the first desin so the stock hotend and 1:1 replacements woudn't fit (I usd the 6 fin BMS as reference and not the 7 fin one). That means all the parts aside the duct wont fit anymore and has o be reprinted in case you printed them already ( I guess nobody did but just a note in case)
- Added a mount for the BMS fin
