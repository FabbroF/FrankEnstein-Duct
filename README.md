## Welcome to the release version of the FrankEnstein V2 Toolhead!

As the brainchild of KevinAKASam and successor to the orginal Frank toolhead, Frank 2 builds upon it's predecessor by being even more modular with support for a wide vareity of hotends and extruders for the Ender 3 and similar with its carriage plate mount as well as as any printer with a front MGN12H linear rail (with some tweaking depending on the printer). Frank 2 features double sided dual fan cooling for either 4010 or 5015 blower fans and well as the option of either 3010 or 4010 fans (with printed adapter) for hotend cooling. The entire tool head is held together securely by 4 screws to the mount and 2 from the extruder mount for easy assembly and disassembly. As in Frank 1, Frank 2 also uses standard Voron spec heat set inserts (M3x5x4) to ensure the longevity of your printed parts while assembling and dissaembling.
